## PHP Chess Server

PHP Ratchet WebSocket server using [PHP Chess](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess).

### Demo

Check out [this demo](https://www.chesslablab.com).

> Please note the sandbox server might not be up and running all the time.

### Setup

Clone the `chesslablab/chess-server` repo into your projects folder as it is described in the following example:

    $ git clone git@github.com:chesslablab/chess-server.git

Then `cd` the `chess-server` directory and install the Composer dependencies:

    $ composer install

Create an `.env` file:

    $ cp .env.example .env

Finally if you're not using Docker make sure to install the Stockfish chess engine.

```
$ sudo apt-get install stockfish
```
